Team Name: Teach Me How To Duggy

Project Chosen:
	Recreate Dig Dug Arcade Game

Project Description:
	This project is going to be a recreation of the classic arcade game "Dig Dug". The project is meant to create an easily accessible user interface for a player to play this classic game. It will encompass all of the original features of Dig Dug, including fluent player movement, easy controls to move, and utilize the weapon air pump, seamless environment interaction, a complex AI enemy system, a scoring system, and a dynamic difficulty change as the player progresses through the respective levels of the game. We plan to have two members working deeply on the "back" end aspects of the project, such as lower level class design, player movement, environment, AI behaviors, etc, another person working mainly on the "upper" level aspects, such as the GUI, making sure the  graphics and user interface of the project are tied well together, and the fourth person having their part in both sections. This person will focus mainly on the top level aspects of the project (GUI, interface), but will need to deeply understand all aspects because they will also be in charge of making sure that all of the individual aspects that the other members design are integrated properly. This includes things like a Main function, making sure all calling is clear and conventional, and that both upper and lower level design work well together - essentially, putting the back and front together. They will also ensure that tests are being carried properly, and that proper formatting is followed as well.

Team Members:
	Patrick Newhart - pjn006 - SCRUM MASTER
	Tom Ficcadenti - tjf010 - PROJECT OWNER
	Levi Adair - laa024
	Sam Greenberg - spg011

Perceived Strengths and Weaknesses:
              Patrick - Good with project management and overall picture - so will be utilized as project manager, scrum master, organizer. Struggles with the beginning steps of a project, but once the pieces are there, very strong in connecting and solidifying final pieces. (ie. Putting the graphics with the classes, and events on the screens, etc.)

              Tom - Tom has a lot of experience with GUI and front end stuff. Weaker doing foundations. Will be utilized for graphics, gui, etc.


              Sam - Weakness is working with Swing, and event handling. Much better concept of the foundations of large scale projects.(will set up character classes)


              Levi - Backend is stronger. Will focus on foundations as well. (Focusing on grid formation)

There should not be any compiling or downloading from git errors, just make sure all of the directories are identical to the ones that are in the repository - since there are internal file calls.
Our MainView.java class is the program executable. This should carry out all of the other functionalities for the game.
